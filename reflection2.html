	This quarter had a lot of things happen in it, though not immidietly obvious.<br>
	Some stuff that happened are really clear, and some feel like a blur.<br>
	Some say this quarter felt so long, and a lot of people cant believe its already ending.<br>
	Personally, I cant believe its ending already, it felt like 1st quarter was just a week ago.<br>
	I think the line between where first quarter ended and where 2nd quarter was a blur, though it was supposedly clearly defined.<br>
	I thought intrams was still first quarter, but then realized its already considered as a 2nd quarter activity.<br>
	The historical figure also took up a majority of the quarter, making it seem like barely any time has passed.<br>
	For me, its hard to list down the activities that happened in 2nd quarter, it feels like there was barely any.<br>
	Historical Figure, Booklandia, and even Vpop, all seem to blur together, and I can hardly tell them apart.<br>
	However, over all the quarter was still pretty enjoyable, though it went by in a flash.<br><br>

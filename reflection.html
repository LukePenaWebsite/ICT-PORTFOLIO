		<!--This quarter was fun and interesting, covering things that i'd never experienced before in my time using html.
			Now I have deeper insight to how the html functions. Learning differnt ways to incorperate content and add
			cool new features like forms and tables were pretty interesting and are usefull pieces of knowledge that I
			can use in making cool webpages. These were really fun to experiment with, and I hope that CSS
			will be a wonderful new rabbit hole to explore.-->
